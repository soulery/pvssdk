Only users with correct administrative privileges can use programming commands. Non-administrators, that do not have elevated privileges and attempt to use these commands, will receive the \u2018Invalid access\u2019 message.\n\n\nFour different programming interfaces exist:\n\n\n\n\nManagement Command Line Interface (SOAP SERVER)\n\n\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Server Programmer Interface\n\n\nPowerShell Programmer Interface with Objects\n\n\nPowerShell Programmer Interface (Deprecated)\n\n\n\n\nThis document provides the information needed to use this interface.\n\n\nUsing the SOAP Server Interface\n\n\nUse the information that follows to manage a Provisioning Service\u2019s implementation from the SOAP SERVER interface.\nThe SOAP API permits you to do everything that can be done using the Console.\n\n\nClient Proxy\n\n\nIf Visual Basic or C# is going to be used to interface with the SOAP interface, the svcutil.exe tool, provided with Microsoft Visual Studio can be used to generate the client side proxy.\n\n\nsvcutil.exe /out:CommandSet.cs http://host_name:8000/pvs/mapi/commandset\n\n\nsvcutil.exe /language:vb /out:CommandSet.bas http://host_name:8000/pvs/mapi/commandset\n\n\nWhere \nhost_name\n is the server\u2019s hostname.\n\n\nShort
